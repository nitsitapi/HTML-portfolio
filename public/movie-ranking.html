<h2> top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>
Honestly a really good movie, imma be honest not really a big movie guy. Not to mention the musician
aspect and this easily makes it into my #1. The acting is incredible
, cinematography is top notch, and much more. If you haven't you
need to check this one out.

<h3>End of Evangelion</h3>
<p>
Im going to be honest I still too this day barely know what the 
hell this one is about but man did it not keep my attention the 
whole time. The visuals are great, music is astounding and its 
touch on the psychology of the characters and development they go 
through makes it into my top 3.

<h3>Avengers:EndGame</h3> 
<p>
Now I know this ain't everyones top 3 but seeing this movie
in theaters opening night was an experience and being there 
was cool to just witness the events take place.
